        "whatAreYourGoalsBeingAMentor": "Computer science and tech has become a broad field, ranging from Big Data science to using VR to help people with chronic illnesses surpass their fears and trauma, yet the competition is getting more instense every year. I recall as a freshman, especially as a woman in computer science, I was so intimidated by the amount of work that I knew had to be accomplished if I wanted my resume to stand out and if I wanted to feel as if I belonged in this major. My knowledge is not as deep as a professor's on computer science nor a researcher; however, I do have two-three years of experience in this major, both inside and outside the classroom, that I would love to share to others that are unsure about where to apply for internships, how to excel in this major, and naturally what learning languages and working on personal projects can do for them. To end, my main goal is to have mentees feel ready and motivated to work on personal projects and how to get started on them and also how they can boost their resumes and what Rutgers has to offer for them (USACS, hackathons, classes, research, etc). I'm taking less credits this semester, about 16, so I know I have the time to get to know other computer science majors this semester - to help them but most importantly learn from them as well.",

        "whatHaveYouWorkedOnInThePastcurrently": "I am a rising junior for RU Comp Sci and I recently just ended my first internship for United Health Group, where I was a technology development intern under Optum Tech. I mainly learned how to work with people for 8-10 hours a day when they were complete strangers to me in May, also I learned some data science, BDPaaS, full stack development including working with the MEAN stack, and how to use public servers and APIs such as api.ai, AWS, and Heroku. While I have not attended many hackathons, actually I've been to 2 hackathons - still proud that I went and was able to survive and at least get halfway through my projects - I have worked on a main personal project called Selfcare Bot. It's not a ChatBot but it's more like a frontend app that helps patients with chronic illnesses, specifically depressed patients and patients with memory trauma, track how they feel and their thought processes. There is a communication gap between healthcare professionals and the patient. I believe that patients should play an active role rather than a passive one in the doctor patient relationship - because motivating themselves to feel better and the nurse being on the sidelines is vital to one's confidence and quality of life as a patient. I was also an Aresty Research Assistant in the ECE department from August 2016-May 2017 so any mentees interested in EE or CE research can come to me with questions. I mainly learned frontend development, working with Android SDK, and learned about security engineering, specifically user authentication. Lastly, I am just starting OIT consulting in the fall to hopefully learn more about the hardware side to computers and monitors and printers (this will only take 7-9 hours out of my week). ",
        "whatAreSomeOfYourInterestsOutsideOfTech": "I am on the club travel tennis team at Rutgers I spend like three-four hours a week hitting on the court with some friends. I'm a concert fanatic most of my money goes to ben and jerrys ice cream and rap, edm, and alternative concerts. And in my free time I'll grab a bit to eat with friends, just spend some time relaxing reading a nonfiction novel, or continue working on one of my landscape paintings - hit me up if you want someone to paint you a nice colorful landscape!",

I'm really big on identifying and understanding problems and working on fixing them (from a life standpoint as well as a tech standpoint), so I'd want to encourage that thought process with my mentees as well. \n\nOf course, I also want to get my mentees involved with USACS/HackRU and with becoming leaders in their community, because having a strong community is a blessing and being a part of the people who grow the community is amazing and *omg*.\n\nIf I have time, I'd also love to help someone out with learning Python/Flask, because I think it's a great way of understanding how backend web dev works and it's quite straightforward to learn.\n\nNote: I am ***VERY*** busy this semester, but I know how it feels when a mentor ghosts on you! I aim to be super responsive over Slack/Messenger/text/email/smoke signal (okay, maybe not that last one), even if meeting in person doesn't work out that often.",
